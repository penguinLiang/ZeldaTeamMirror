## NAME OF FILE  ##

__Name of .cs file:__ Wave.cs

__Author of .cs file:__ Henry

__Minutes to review:__ 2

__Specific Comments (Readability):__

Incredibly straight forward implementation of the deserialized wave that allows an infinite scale.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__

Clean code, well named.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__

Really late waves could lead to very high memory usage because the array size scales, so it could be changed to return a tuple of enemy type and count.
