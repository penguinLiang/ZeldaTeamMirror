## AlchemyCoinItem  ##

__Name of .cs file:__ AlchemyCoinItem.cs

__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred

__Minutes to review:__ 5

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
All variable names follow conventions and make sense. Spacing is good and code overall looks clean. Boolean expressions could be spaced out. All methods just around or under 10 lines.


__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
The code appears to be very concise. The file itself does not have any unnecessary coupling. The methods appear to be very efficient and with high cohesion.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
Looks good. Just space out the boolean expression.
