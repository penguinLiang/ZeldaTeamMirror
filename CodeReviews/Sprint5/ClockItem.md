__Name of .cs file:__ ClockItem.cs

__Author of .cs file:__ Quinn Shaner

__Minutes to review:__ 4

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
Variable names are specific, and code is formatted nicely. One small questionable detail is that the if condition "_price>0" has no spaces.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
Code is well-organized and not too cluttered. It helps that the class is extending an abstract class.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
Maybe the clock could wait for Link to get off of it to purchase it again instead of just waiting 90 frames to reset.
