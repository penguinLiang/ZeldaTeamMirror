## HighScoreClient  ##

__Name of .cs file:__ HighScoreClient.cs

__Author of .cs file:__ Chase

__Minutes to review:__ 5

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
At a glance, everything uses a specific naming convention. The file istelf is less than 70 lines, and the longest method is under 25 lines. Everything is there for a reason. We're using pure methods messed from c#.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
Due to the nature of this file, it's coupled with System, IO, Net, and Text. That's not too many files in the grand scope of things, but it still introduces higher coupling. The file itself is very coherent-- everything has a place and is there for a reason. 

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
I can't think of any hypothetical changes for this file, it's very clean.
