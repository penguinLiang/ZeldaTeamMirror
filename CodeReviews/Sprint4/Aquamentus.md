## Aquamentus.cs ; Re-review based on fireball implementation ##

__Name of .cs file:__ Aquamentus.cs

__Author of .cs file:__ Steven

__Minutes to review:__ 1

__Specific Comments (Readability):__

Very good readability. Basic commands are grouped together in a way that is understandable. Good work.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__

Code quality is fine, consistent with the rest of the code quality of the project. Only thing is the possibility of adding underscores before local variable objects, but that is it.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__

No other hypothetical changes. All looks good.
