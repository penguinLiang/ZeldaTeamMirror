__Minutes to review:__ 5

__Specific Comments (Readability):__

Very simple and plain to read. All variable names make sense and follow proper naming conventions. Perhaps the naming of fromAquamentus could be improved, but in the context of the project, it makes sense. 

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__

High quality. No issues to note. The use of "_framesDelayed++ >= FramesToDisappear" could be easily misconstrued without a note, but makes the code better quality imo.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__

Rename fromAquamentus. Remove magic numbers.
