__Name of .cs file:__ EnemySpriteFactory.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Steven
__Minutes to review:__ 1

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
Easy to read, and clear. The only possible downside is that calling the Sprite constructor has certain variables which are all unspecified in the parameters, which might be confusing for a first look for whoever didn't look at the Sprite constructor, but otherwise easy to understand.

## IDrawable.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ IDrawable.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 2

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
Well-organized interface with clear method names.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
The interface only establishes the namespace and the unimplemented methods, as an interface should.

No hypothetical changes necessary. Everything here supports change.

---

## IEnemy.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ IEnemy.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 1

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
IEnemy now extends IDrawable in addition to IMoveable and ISpawnable, so enemies can be drawn.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
There may be concern about the interface extending too many other interfaces, but three seems to be fine.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
Just like how IPlayer now has methods to face different directions, IEnemy may benefit from that as well because enemies can be knocked back when taking damage, but they would face the opposite direction they're moving.

---

## IMoveable.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ IMoveable.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 2

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
The only four methods in IMoveable now are one method to move in each direction.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
No Idle() method is needed because it is the default state, and things only move in the direction they face except when taking damage, so the removed methods makes sense.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
It may be optimal to have one movement method that takes a direction parameter instead of four different movement methods.

---

## IPlayer.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ IPlayer.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 2

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
The player now has the ability to face different directions instead of just moving in different directions.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
The four added face methods have well-defined names that cohere with the rest of the methods appropriately.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
It may be optimal to have one face method that takes a direction parameter instead of four different face methods.

---

## Zelda.csproj ##

__Name of .cs file:__ Zelda.csproj
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 1

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
The project file now includes all of the enemies and commands added in this sprint, and it excludes the command and folders that are no longer used.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
N/A - Project file

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
N/A - Project file

---

## ZeldaGame.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ ZeldaGame.cs
__Author of .cs file:__ Jarred
__Minutes to review:__ 4

__Specific Comments (Readability):__
The changes are very clear: There is no longer a CurrentSprite property, Enemies is now a public property, controllers are now set up in LoadContent() rather than Initialize(), the Enemy sprite factory is set up, and enemies are now handled in Update() and Draw().

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__
Many of the changes have been very conducive to good code quality, such as loading controllers instead of initializing with them. There is also no longer a CurrentSprite, which is good because there isn't just one sprite to handle in the game in this sprint.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__
No hypothetical changes necessary. Everything here supports change as best as it can, as ZeldaGame is an inherently messy class.
