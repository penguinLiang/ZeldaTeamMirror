__Minutes to review:__ 1

__Specific Comments (Readability):__

High readibility. The class itself is organized well so a lot of readibility is loaned to that aspect. Good work.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__

Very standard code quality for an average item class for this project. Conventional and in line, good job.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__

In PlayerEffect function, LinkAddHeart as a name might prove confusing, as it reminds me of adding a heart as a hp, rather than maximum health. Something suggesting maximum health would be less confusing. However, that is a slightly larger design decision outside of this class. Otherwise good.
