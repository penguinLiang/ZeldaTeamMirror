## DirectionUtility.cs ##

__Name of .cs file:__ DirectionUtility.cs 

__Author of .cs file:__ Chase

__Minutes to review:__ 2

__Specific Comments (Readability):__

Very simple and plain to read. All the method names with the exception of RotateAnticlockwise are very readable. I am appalled to see the word Anticlockwise, but since that is technically a word, I will withhold my frustrations.

__Specific Comments (Code Quality):__

Very high quality code. No improvements I could imagine.

__Hypothetical Changes and how current implementation May/Not support change:__

Possibly to remove the RotateAnticlockwise as it is not currently being used by any class.
