# Bugs
## Where we put all of the current bugs, roughly when they were patched or how we plan on addressing them in the future.  

## Enemies

### Known issues: 
__1__: The Goriya sprite will sometimes freeze when moving two perpendicular directions (e.g. left ^ up) at the same time over a long distance. This will not be an issue going forward as Goriya cannot move diagonally in the game and will not be changing sprites that fast with the AI implemented. This is simply an issue with the Goriya being keyboard controlled.  
  (Sprint 2 Bug) (Patched by Chase on 9/27)

__2__: The Damage command can be a bit touchy. Try not to hold the key if you are trying to observe the hurt animation.  
(Sprint 2 Bug)


## Sprites
 __1__: The Rupee sprite has been flipped. From the original game, the blue rupee was solid and the red/yellow rupee should flash between colors.  
 (Sprint 2 Bug) (Patched by Quinn on 9/27)

 __2__: The Goriya sprite is supposed to alternate between 4 differnet palettes when damaged. Currently only alternating between 2.  
 (Sprint 2 Bug) (Patched by Steven on 9/27)

 __3__: The bomb explosion, in the game will have 4 more explosion clouds around the bomb in a random area.   
 (Sprint 2 Bug) (Will be patched in Sprint 3)
